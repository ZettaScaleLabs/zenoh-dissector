  # NOTE: In GitHub repository settings, the "Require status checks to pass
  # before merging" branch protection rule ensures that commits are only merged
  # from branches where specific status checks have passed. These checks are
  # specified manually as a list of workflow job names. Thus we use this extra
  # job to signal whether all CI checks have passed.
